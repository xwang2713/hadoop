description: |
  Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFSâ„¢) is the primary storage system
  used by Hadoop applications.
  .
  HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes them on
  compute nodes throughout a cluster to enable reliable, extremely
  rapid computations.
  .
  The Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) requires one unique server, the
  namenode, which manages the block locations of files on the filesystem.
provides:
  namenode:
    interface: dfs
requires:
  datanode:
